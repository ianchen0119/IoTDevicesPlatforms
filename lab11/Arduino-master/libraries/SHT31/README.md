# SHT31

Arduino library for the SHT31 temperature and humidity sensor

# Description

The SHT3x family of sensors should work up to 1 MHz I2C

This library should also work for SHT30 and SHT35 but these are 
not tested yet.

| SENSOR | Temperature accuracy | Humidity accuracy |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| SHT30 | ~0.3 | 2 |
| SHT31 | ~0.3 | 1.5 |
| SHT35 | ~0.2 | 1.5 |
