# FRAM_I2C

Arduino library for I2C FRAM 

# Description

FRAM is a library to read and write (over I2C) to an FRAM module. 
FRAM is much faster than EEPROM and almost as fast as Arduino UNO RAM.
Another imaportant feature is that FRAM keeps its content after a reboot (non-volatile)

Types of FRAM it should work with
